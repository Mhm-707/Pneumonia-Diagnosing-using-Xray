I have used my knowledge from Coursera courses to implement a Binary Classifier for Pneumonia detection I mainly used Keras library to code my model.
My primary concerns while I was working on the project is to implement the classifier with very high accuracy and at the same time keeping the model size small. 
I used Kaggle Dataset (Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)). My hope is that these models can help to improve the diagonsing process :) 


Model characteristics:
•	Test Accuracy: 99.989784%
•	Model Size: 56.9 MB.
•	Training Optimizer: Adam.
•	Size of The Training Image: 5215 images (for both categories)
•	Training Time: 23 minutes (Using Colab GPU)
•	Number of Parameters: 4,728,369

I am uploading the trained model (,h5) so that you can use the load command to directly use the model without training.
